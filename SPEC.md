# BibLens – Specification

## Vision

BibLens is an Obsidian plugin that provides instant Bible passage previews on hover.

The project is designed for academic and research workflows and aims to support
parallel texts, multiple translations, and morphology in future versions.

Initial development focuses on Czech Bible reference notation.

The plugin must:

- Work on desktop and mobile
- Operate fully offline
- Use local vault data for Bible texts
- Avoid Node-only runtime dependencies

---

## MVP (Version 0.1)

### Goal

When a user writes a Bible reference such as:

- Mt 1,3
- Gn 22,1-19
- Iz 11

and hovers over it in Reading View,
a popover appears displaying a preview.

For MVP:

- The popover may initially display a placeholder message.
- No external services are allowed.
- No external backend is allowed.
- Reference detection must work reliably for basic Czech notation.

---

## Reference Format (MVP)

The MVP supports Czech-style Bible reference notation.

Characteristics:

- Space between book abbreviation and chapter number
- Comma between chapter and verse
- Dash for verse ranges

Examples:

- Mt 1,3
- Gn 22,1-19
- Iz 11

Notes:

- Multiple Czech abbreviation standards exist.
- The MVP will initially use a predefined internal abbreviation mapping.
- Support for configurable abbreviation systems is planned for future versions.

---

## Non-Goals (MVP)

- No cloud services
- No text-fabric backend
- No morphology
- No multi-language UI
- No advanced reference parsing
- No cross-book range parsing

---

## Technical Constraints

- Must support mobile Obsidian.
- Must use only Obsidian API for vault access.
- Must not rely on Node runtime features.
- Changes must remain small and incremental.
- Parsing logic must remain testable independently of Obsidian UI.

---

## Architecture Principles

- Separate reference parsing from UI logic.
- Separate data provider from UI layer.
- Keep parsing logic deterministic and unit-testable.
- All new features must update TESTPLAN.md.
